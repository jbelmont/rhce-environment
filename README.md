# RHCE environment
This repository contains a vagrant configuration which describes infrastructure of nodes that can be used for RHCE exam preparation (EX294). Idea of creating such a similiar project in comparision to what's currently available is to provide set of exercises and solutions which will be relevant to the configuration and allow the people preparing for the exam to check exact steps they need to follow in order to solve them.

## Exercises
